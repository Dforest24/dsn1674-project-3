				<p>We’ve been serving essentially the same brunch since we opened and don’t plan on stopping. Eggs, meat, home fries and toast. “Just one meat? No, honey it comes with all the meat.”</p>

				<p>Our after-6 menu has completely changed over the last two years with our new owner. We have all the classics, done like no one else does them; we have liquor and beer, all at a fair price. The menu is constantly changing to suit what is freshly available and the season. Our staple burger is cooked to however you chose (we like it red) and served on a grilled cheese bread. Our fried chicken is served on a bed of brussel sprouts and a chilli spiced pulled pork. Our goal is to take every dish that’s available everywhere and add our personal twist to it.</p>
